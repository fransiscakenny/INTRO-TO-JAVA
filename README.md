# INTRO-TO-JAVA
Some of my first simple and fun projects that sparked my interest to learn more about Computer Science.
These were the programs that I wrote for my first ever Computer Science class called Business & Information Technology 115. 
The programs were written in Java programming language, and in my humble opinion, these programs are a really good for 
people who have never coded before to try, since it is relatively easy and fun. 

Try copying it out in your compiler, and please shoot me any e-mail if you have any questions. :-)
